# this version is not stable! it needs to be tested!

test
- compile sample before testing;

chores
- make (test|clean)

feature
- trace ctors when they are defined (may need to rethink the logic);
- support generic text injection (example is __FUNCSIG__ in msvc and __FUNCTION__ in gcc, or sth similar)

+ add support for structs, classes, enums;
+ rethink to cover the following case:
static type_ = {blabla}
+ interactive mode - choose which file (s) to go to,
  and which functions to cover, then do it;
  may need a different approach like 
  maintaining internal map of covered/uncovered identifiers,
  also may need identifiers themselves
  (maybe makes sense to use clang tools for this one)
